    <hr/>
    <p>I'm Jesutomide. I studied Electrical and computer engineering in 
        Kwara state unviersity. I did
        a 6 months internship program in Systemspecs (HumanManager), and 
        learned about HumanManager's technology in the HR space through working
        on a migration project. During this period, I adapted to the working environment
        and I really enjoyed what the project process even though it was tough and draining.
        After HumanManager  I worked with mostly hardware and created a customized home automation
        system.
        Now, my desire is to learn more about technology and I aim to do this by learning software
        development. This is just the start!
